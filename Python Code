# ---- Jake Ryan ----
# ---Assignment â€“ Base64 Encoding and Decoding---
# This script will ask the user whether he/she wishes to encode or decode a file using base64.
# The user will then be prompted for the appropriate file name.
# The files will be in the same folder as your python script, so path is not an issue.
